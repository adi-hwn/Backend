Currently prototype2 is being worked on

to use, input filename into main,
then adjust "Vertical Threshold" until horizontal lines in frame4 disappear.

finally, adjust "Note Threshold" until only notes are selected
You may have to fiddle with vertical threshold and note threshold to detect only the notes.
